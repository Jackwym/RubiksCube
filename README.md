list of issues / goals:

1) cube degrades over time due to floating point rounding (rotations rotate the cube slightly more than they should)

3) any rotations done at the beginning can be undone to show issues (first rotation of 360 degrees can be reversed with four 'r' inputs to show problems)
   note: (6) could solve this problem

5) impliment movement of sides only

6) impliment and execute a generated scramble <-- being worked on

DONE 7) add prime moves

8) add 2 moves (e.g. R2) that can only be performed by the program, not the user (to scramble and (9)solve)

9) (maybe) create a bot to undo the scramble

10) (maybe) spin camera around the cube while it is being scrambled / solved by the bot

11) (maybe) loop (8) to create a cool background for my computer :D
